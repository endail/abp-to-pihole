# CNAME-Trackers-For-PiHole

AdGuard released a [repo](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/cname-trackers) containing lists of CNAME-cloaked trackers. Unfortunately those lists are in Adblock Plus format, which PiHole does not accept.

The Python script in this repo converts all the Adguard lists into a single list which can be added to PiHole. The list is updated once per day.
